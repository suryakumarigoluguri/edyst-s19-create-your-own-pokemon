# edyst-s19-create-your-own-pokemon
To create,read,update and delete pokemon cards using database backend API 
Here I used flask to  create database
Before getting started
We have to install flask-sqlalchemy as
$ pip install flask_sqlalchemy
After that you have to run the app.py before running
you have to import db and create dbas in python mode
>>> from crud import db
>>> db.create_all()
After running the app.py in debug mode you can perform above operations
